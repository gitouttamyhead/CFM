# Email Notification System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the email notification system for the Come Follow Me insights application.

## Overview

The email notification system allows creators to send email notifications to users when new insights are created. It also provides the ability to resend notifications for existing insights.

## Features

- **New Insight Notifications**: Send emails when creating new insights
- **Resend Notifications**: Resend emails for existing insights
- **User Selection**: Choose which users to notify
- **Direct Links**: Emails contain direct links to the insights
- **Notification Logging**: All sent notifications are logged in Firestore

## Setup Steps

### 1. EmailJS Account Setup

1. Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account
2. Verify your email address
3. Add your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

### 2. Create Email Template

1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use the template from `emailjs-template-example.html` as a reference
4. Save the template and note the **Template ID**

### 3. Configure EmailJS Settings

1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Account" â†’ "API Keys"
2. Note your **Public Key**
3. Go to "Email Services" and note your **Service ID**

### 4. Update Configuration

Edit the `email-notifications.js` file and update the configuration:

```javascript
const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
    serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID', // Replace with your EmailJS service ID
    templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', // Replace with your template ID
    userId: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' // Replace with your EmailJS public key
};
```

### 5. Add EmailJS SDK to Pages

The EmailJS SDK has already been added to the Old Testament and Gospel Topics pages. For other pages, add these lines in the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<script src="email-notifications.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### For New Insights

1. Create a new insight as usual
2. Check the "Send email notification to users about this insight" checkbox
3. Save the insight
4. A modal will appear allowing you to select which users to notify
5. Select users and click "Send Notification"

### For Existing Insights

1. Navigate to any insight page
2. If you have admin/editor permissions, you'll see a "Resend Email" button
3. Click the button to open the user selection modal
4. Select users and send the notification

## Email Template Variables

The email template uses these variables:

- `{{to_email}}` - Recipient email addresses
- `{{insight_title}}` - Title of the insight
- `{{insight_summary}}` - Summary or preview of the insight content
- `{{insight_category}}` - Category (Old Testament, Gospel Topics, etc.)
- `{{insight_url}}` - Direct link to view the insight
- `{{action_type}}` - "created" or "updated"
- `{{creator_name}}` - Name of the person who created the insight
- `{{created_date}}` - Date the insight was created

## User Management

The system automatically fetches users from the `users` collection in Firestore. Each user document should have:

```javascript
{
    email: "user@example.com",
    name: "User Name", // Optional, defaults to email prefix
    role: "user" // user, editor, or admin
}
```

## Notification Logging

All sent notifications are logged in the `emailNotifications` collection with this structure:

```javascript
{
    insightId: "insight_document_id",
    recipientEmails: ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
    sentAt: timestamp,
    type: "new_insight" | "updated_insight",
    status: "sent"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"EmailJS not available" error**
   - Make sure the EmailJS SDK is loaded before `email-notifications.js`
   - Check that the EmailJS script tag is present

2. **"No users found to notify"**
   - Ensure users exist in the `users` collection
   - Check that user documents have valid email addresses

3. **Email not sending**
   - Verify EmailJS configuration (service ID, template ID, user ID)
   - Check EmailJS dashboard for any service errors
   - Ensure your email service is properly configured

4. **Template variables not working**
   - Verify template variable names match exactly
   - Check that the template is saved and published in EmailJS

### Testing

1. Create a test insight with email notification enabled
2. Send to a test email address
3. Check both the recipient's inbox and EmailJS dashboard
4. Verify the direct link works correctly

## Security Considerations

- EmailJS public key is safe to expose in client-side code
- User email addresses are only used for notifications
- All email sending is logged for audit purposes
- Only admins and editors can send notifications

## Cost Considerations

- EmailJS free tier includes 200 emails per month
- Additional emails cost $0.20 per 100 emails
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Email Preferences**: Allow users to opt out of notifications
2. **Notification Types**: Different templates for different insight categories
3. **Scheduled Notifications**: Send notifications at specific times
4. **Bulk Operations**: Send notifications for multiple insights
5. **Email Analytics**: Track open rates and click-through rates
